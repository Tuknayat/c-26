Chana Bhatura is a spicy, tasty and a filling dish. I have eaten this dish at many places in Punjab and Delhi. Each restaurants or dhaba (eateries on highways) have their own flavors and taste in the chickpea curry. In some places the curry is very spicy, at other places it has tangy taste and the consistency of the curry also varies from slightly thick to semi-dry and dry.

This recipe has spicy flavors. This is my mom’s recipe and unlike other versions of chickpea curry recipes posted on the blog, this one has a homely taste and flavor. It does not taste like the restaurant or dhaba versions but taste very good.

Even the bhature size and flavor varies from restaurants to restaurants. The bhature ideally should be less oily and should puff fully. They should also be eaten hot and fresh. If you parcel the bhature from a restaurant then you won’t get the real taste as they become limp and dense.

I always make the bhatura recipes that are already posted on the blog. I have not yet tried making any other version of bhatura as these work best for me always.
